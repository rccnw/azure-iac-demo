The file resource-group-arm.bicep will create 4 resources within an existing resource group. (See below for how it was created)

This will exactly recrate the infrastructure created by the terraform scripts.

TODO:  this bicep code is not parameterized, it needs to be.


Required:

1) resource group exists
2) local bicep file exists (see how to below)
3) same region as resouce group is declared in bicep.



1) If necessary, create a resource group, with the name expected by the bicep for the contained resources. Use 'upwork-test-rg' for example

    az group create --name upwork-test-rg --location <REGION>>

2) deploy the resources to the resource group as defined in the bicep file.

    az deployment group create --resource-group "upwork-test-rg" --template-file "resource-group-arm.bicep" 




How resource-group-arm.bicep was created

1) The terraform script was run to deploy azure resources. (set vars as required first)
2) In the created Azure resource group, select Automation export template. This displays an ARM script for all the resources in the resource group.
3) copy the ARM script to a local file 'resource-group-arm.json'.
4) perform az decompilation to create bicep file 'resource-group-arm.bicep': 
    
    az bicep decompile --file resource-group-arm.json
